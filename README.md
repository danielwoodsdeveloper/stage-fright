## Description

**Stage Fright** is a party game that will force even the most extroverted person out of their comfort zone.

Based on games like **Cards Against Humanity**, this game is broken up into rounds, and in each round one player is selected to be the judge. The other players will then perform for the judge. What will they perform? Well it could be a song, a rap, or even an interpretive dance. Examples include:

* Write and perform a short rap that tells the story of a very old man having an over-the-top argument with a duck at the White House.
* Write and read aloud a short poem that tells the story of a baby getting into a fist-fight with the Prime Minister in a KFC.
* Perform an interpretive dance that depicts Shannon Noll aggressively licking a dog in Disneyland.

## Development

**Stage Fright** is built with *Preact* and is intended to be light-weight and no more complicated than needed.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and preact-render-spy 
npm run test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [CLI Readme](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Testing

This repo contains a handful of tests to gurantee the core functionality of **Stage Fright** works as expected. These tests are built atop *Preact Render Spy*, a JavaScript testing utility based on *Enzyme* (which is designed by Airbnb for use with React, which is itself based on *Facebook's Jest* utility).

Please endeavour to update these tests where appropriate, or extend them. Please also ensure changes do not cause these tests to fail.
